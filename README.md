> **2024-11-26** â€” We have [a new suite of starter projects](https://craftcms.com/starters) that make better use of Craft 5, and are available in a variety of front-end frameworks!

# Craft CMS Blog Starter

This blog starter project is used for internal automation and testing, particularly for documentation and reference material. It contains a minimal set of features required to inspect console commands, GraphQL schemas, and configuration.

With the introduction of dedicated [starter projects](https://craftcms.com/starters), we no longer recommend using this as a development springboard.
