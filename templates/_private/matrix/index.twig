{#
  This template expects a `blocks` variable. For example, if an entry has a
  matrix field, "Body Content" with the handle "bodyContent" then you can
  iterate over the Matrix blocks dynamically, like so:

  ```
  {% include "_private/matrix" with {
    blocks: entry.bodyContent.all()
  } %}
  ```

  This template is named `index.twig`. Any template named `index.html` or
  `index.twig` can be omitted from the include path. The above code is the
  same as:

  ```
  {% include "_private/matrix/index" with {
    blocks: entry.bodyContent.all()
  }  %}
  ```

  Matrix blocks are elements. To get the blocks from a Matrix field requires an
  element query:

  ```
  entry.bodyContent.all()
  ```

  The `with` part of the include lets you provide a key/value object where keys
  name variables for the scope of the included template. For example:

  ```
  ... with { blocks: entry.bodyContent.all() } ...
  ```

  That means that this included template can expect a variable named `blocks`
  which holds the result of the element query that fetches the Matrix blocks.

  This template iterates over the blocks and attempts to include a template named
  by each block's handle. For example, if an entry included a Body Content field
  with the following blocks selected:

  Body Content
  - Rich Text (richText)
  - Image (image)
  - Embed (embed)

  Then the loop in this template would include templates in this order:

  1. "_private/matrix/blocks/richText"
  2. "_private/matrix/blocks/image"
  4. "_private/matrix/blocks/embed"

  If you add a new Matrix block, then you can create a file in the
  `_private/matrix/blocks` folder named by the block handle to render content
  for that block.

{% for block in blocks %}
  {% include "_private/matrix/blocks/" ~ block.type %}
